One of our admins, before his agonizing death by being squished by an elephpant, changed the passwords on all our servers! Postmortem autopsy found in his stomach a usb pen drive with sole file: WTF.BIN, as well as high concentration of epinephprine in his blood. We need our servers!!

Hint: File offset 17702
