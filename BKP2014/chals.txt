Door 1
Crypto : 500

You need to open door no 5 in a secret facility. We have been trying to brute-force the door without success. One of our agents was able to infiltrate the control room and take a picture. The server is known to use some kind of problematic random number generator for the authentication. Open the door. The service is accessible on 54.186.6.201:8901, good luck with your mission. UPDATE/HINT: LFSR.
